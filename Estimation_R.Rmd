The dataset prostate comes from a study on 97 men with prostate cancer who were due
to receive a radical prostatectomy. Fit a model with lpsa as the response and l cavol as
the predictor. Record the residual standard error and the R2
. Now add lweight, svi,
lpph, age, l cp, pgg45 and gleason to the model one at a time. For each model record
the residual standard error and the R2
. Plot the trends in these two statistics.

5. Using the prostate data, plot lpsa against l cavol. Fit the regressions of lpsa on lcavol
and lcavol on lpsa. Display both regression lines on the plot. At what point do the two
lines intersect
