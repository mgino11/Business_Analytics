```

## HW 1

In this homework assignment, you will explore, analyze and model a data set containing approximately 2200 records. 

Each record represents a professional baseball team from the years 1871 to 2006 inclusive. Each record has the performance of the team for the given year, with all of the statistics adjusted to match the performance of a 162 game season

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)

# load data

ball
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
