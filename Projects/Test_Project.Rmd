## Linear Regression

[\*A Modern Approach To Regression With R.pdf.pdf](file:///C:/Users/maria/Downloads/A%20Modern%20Approach%20To%20Regression%20With%20R.pdf.pdf)

$X = PREDICTOR$ ( explanatory, independent)

$y=DEPENDEDNT$ (response)

### Least Squares 

$E(Y|X=x)=B_0 +B_1x$

Assuming that:

$$Var(Y|X =x) = \sigma^2$$

#### Least Squares Estimates

intercept =

$$\hat{\beta_{0}} = \overline{y} - \hat{\beta_1} \overline{x}$$

slope =

$$
slope = \frac{SXY}{SXX}
$$

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
